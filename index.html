    	<h3>Introduction</h3>
    	<p> These are a random selection of calmer, more laid back rap music that I sometimes listen to. This list is in no particular order and most of these titles are explicit, though a clean version is likely available.</p>

    	<p> The production on this song in my opinion is pretty nice. I also like the overall mood of both parts of the song, especially the second verse. It has the perfect level of melodicity. This song is enjoyable when you're alone with not much else to think about.</p>

    	<p> This song is from one of my favourite albums in recent times. The chorus is memorable, but what I really like is the last part, with both the bridge sung by Johnta Austin and the flow of the verse after that. The production is also very strong.</p>

    	<p> When the album this song is from first came out, I found this song in particular to be very underrated. The piano in the melody is catchy, as is the chorus by Travis Scott. The features compliment the production well. A close second to this on the same album (correlating to the theme of calming rap) would probably be Trance.</p>

      <div class="Text"> 
    	<p> In my opinion one of the best recent Drake songs to come out, and probably the most popular song on the list. The first part of the song is on the more upbeat vibe, then transitions into a slower more melodic track, though both parts are great to sit down and listen to without any distractions.</p>

        <p>These are just some songs that I find myself coming back to when I'm either in a certain mood, or I want to distract myself from life. ALthough I'm able to relax to all of them, I do think they're all pretty different, and I like that kind of variety when listening to my music. Thanks for reading. </p>
